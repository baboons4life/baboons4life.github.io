<p>The olive baboon is the most extensively 
    distributed of the baboon family, inhabiting
    equatorial Africa from Senegal, across to northern
    Zaire, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and northern Tanzania.
    The olive baboon have large ears, thick fur, sharp teeth,
    pointed muzzles and a long tale. You can tell the genders
    apart by the grey furry ruff that the males have around their
    cheeks. The older baboons are lighter in colour than the babies
    which are a dark grey colour almost black, they also have thinner
    fur.Baboons are diurnal, spending most of their time on the ground.
     At night they sleep in trees or cliffs, travelling as a family in 
     the morning to feeding grounds. Before moving off is the time to 
     socialize, while the young ones play. As the day moves towards its
      close, they go back to their sleeping quarters and again spend some time
    socializing, doing activities such as grooming, before they sleep. Olive
    baboons generally live in troops of between 20 to 60 animals, sometimes
     up to 100 individuals. In a typical troop the adult males number 7 or 8
    with two times that number of females and their young. If troops come
     across each other, the larger group may cause the smaller one to be displaced,
      or they just ignore each other. These baboons communicate by means of
       vocalizations and a large range of facial expressions: staring, raising 
       eyebrows, and baring their teeth are displays of aggression.Baboons are
        omnivorous and are experts at foraging in all parts of the environment
         where they live: on the ground, under the ground and in the trees. They eat grasses, seeds, roots, fruit, leaves
         bark, invertebrates, lizards, turtles, fish, frogs, eggs, the young of birds, young mammals, including other primates,
          and crocodile eggs. They eat whatever they can find.
           They shuffle with their hands and feet through the grass while
            they move or sit, in order to flush out a possible meal. In the zoo they
             are fed browse, mixed fruit and vegetables, grapes, bananas, nuts, bean sprouts,
              romaine lettuce, scratch grain, pigeon grain and parrot mix.Predators of the olive baboon
               include all the big cats, such as lions and leopards, wild dogs, hyenas, chimpanzees and crocodiles. 
               Their habitat is being destroyed by agricultural expansion, and when they raid crops they are systematically 
               exterminated. The conflict that arises when baboons live beside humans sometimes leads to populations of baboons
                being relocated for the farmersâ€™ benefit but also to save the baboons. They are sometimes hunted for sport and food.</p>
