<p>Guinea baboons have a rather small natural range in western equatorial Africa, including certain parts of Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Mauretania and Mali. These primates are allopatric animals, which means that they live in isolated populations that don't interbreed. However, where their territories overlap, Guinea baboons usually do interbreed. Preferred habitat of these baboons is woodland savanna, although they occur in a variety of forest and savanna habitats throughout their range. They are also known to live in open terrains such as grasslands and rainforests. During the dry season, large concentrations of these animals can be found around constant sources of water. During the wet season, they typically live in smaller groups.Guinea baboons are generally terrestrial animals, although they are also known to be accomplished climbers. They lead diurnal lifestyle. Guinea baboons are quadrupedal creatures. Like Hamadryas baboons, they have a multi-leveled social system. Their groups are called one male units (OMUs) and typically contain a single mature male, sub-adult males as well as multiple females and young. In order to reduce predation, these groups may occasionally unite into larger aggregations. The leading male of the group don't aggressively herd the community. Instead, it guides the group through corralling, shaking and jumping. Additionally, it will run in order to speed up the movement and will prance when changing the direction. Guinea baboons sleep in large trees, where each group has a single branch to sleep on. These primates sleep at night and look for food during the daytime hours in smaller sub-groups. When foraging, these sub-groups cannot see each other and thus communicate through specific calls. The population of Guinea baboons outside the Niokolo-Koba National Park has suffered from continuous decline as a result of agricultural development, deforestation as well as hunting for food (in Guinea) and for crop destruction. Additionally, in former times, those in Senegal were exported for laboratory use. These baboons are known to form large groups of up to 200 animals. Guinea baboons are very social animals, communicating with conspecifics primarily through calls and physical signals. Moreover, they even use certain vocalizations to communicate with predators.</p>
