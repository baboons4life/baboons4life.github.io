    The area of their distribution covers the greater part of southern Africa. They live in diverse habitats from woodlands to savanna, steppes and sub-desert. Chacma baboons are found in Kalahari Desert as well as on alpine slopes of the Drakensberg. They usually sleep on hills, cliffs or large trees. During the day, these primates avoid arid areas with lack of water. These monkeys are diurnal, spending most of the day on the ground. They are highly sociable animals, living in troops, which consist of 20-80 individuals. The troops include males as well as females with their young. Members of a troop are in close ties with each other, sleeping, feeding and grooming together. During the day the groups split into smaller subgroups, consisting of 4-5 females with their young and a dominant male, who leads the group and defends it from other males. They are always on the alert, living in troops for protection and watching for predators. When threatened, the baboons give out loud barks. Then the males run to attack while the females and young hide in a safe place among the trees. These monkeys are omnivores, feeding upon various species of both plant matter and animals. The Chacma baboons consume grass, flowers, leaves, crowns of some trees such as Cypress tree, seeds such as ones of Acacia nigrens, roots, tree gums, water lilies, tubers, corms and rhizomes. Their usual diet includes also fruits such as figs or Kigelia pinnata fruit. In addition, they eat eggs, insects and small vertebrates. The major threats to the Chacma baboon population include hunting and involvement of the species in laboratory research. These primates are shot as vermin due to raiding crops, damaging pine plantations and preying on livestock. When obtaining food from humans, some baboons can be very aggressive and are frequently killed as "problem animals". They communicate by vocalizations, using about 30 different sounds such as grunting, barking or screaming. They also use gestures such as shoulder shrugs, yawns or lip smacking.
